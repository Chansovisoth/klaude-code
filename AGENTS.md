# Agent Guidance

This file applies to the whole repository. Keep it current when project
behavior changes; future agents should be able to understand the product from
this file before diving into implementation details.

## Project Summary

`klaude-code` is a local-first AI coding agent, version `0.2.0a2`. It runs as a
Python `uv` workspace with a Typer/Rich CLI, Ollama model runtime, local memory,
refreshable knowledge libraries, multi-provider web search, local-first URL
fetching, and MCP servers for the web and knowledge layers.

The main user-facing executable is `klaude`. The full interactive agent is
`klaude chat`; the MCP servers expose Klaude's web and knowledge tools to other
agents, but they are not the full Klaude chat agent.

Workspace layout:

- `apps/cli`: Typer commands, Rich terminal rendering, deterministic command
  reference/help, chat loop wiring, tool display formatting, docs/session/memory
  CLI commands.
- `packages/core`: config loading, Ollama HTTP client, system prompt, agent
  loop, permission gate, memory/session store, runtime context, follow-up and
  retrieval planning.
- `packages/tools_local`: workspace file, grep, shell, and git tools with a
  workspace jail, dirty-tree write lockout, command risk classification, and
  auto-commit support when writes are enabled.
- `packages/knowledge`: chunking, LanceDB vector storage, SQLite FTS5, atomic
  indexing, refreshable docs sources, skill package imports, hybrid retrieval,
  and the knowledge MCP server.
- `packages/web`: relevance-first search routing, provider clients, SearXNG
  compatibility, web cache, direct/Crawl4AI/trafilatura/Exa fetch cascade,
  bounded same-domain crawler, Hugging Face Hub helpers, and the web MCP server.
- `config/examples`: tracked examples for local app config, provider secrets,
  SearXNG service env, online docs seeds, and preset config profiles.
- `deploy/searxng`: tracked SearXNG config mounted into the local container.
- `scripts`: installer and online-docs helper scripts.
- `tests/unit`: unit coverage for config, tools, memory, runtime context, docs,
  skills, knowledge, search, providers, fetch, CLI commands, and dates.

## User-Facing Terms

Use `library` in CLI help, README examples, prompts, and user-facing text for a
named knowledge bucket. Keep `collection` only where compatibility or existing
storage APIs require it.

Preferred public examples:

- `klaude learn URL -l react`
- `klaude query "hooks" -l react`
- `klaude libraries`

Compatibility that must keep working:

- `-c` / `--collection`
- `klaude collections`
- MCP tool parameters named `collection` should still work, but prefer
  `library` where both exist.

## CLI And Chat Commands

The canonical command registry lives in
`apps/cli/src/klaude_cli/main.py`. Never invent Klaude CLI commands, chat slash
commands, aliases, syntax, or examples. Command information shown to the user
must come from this registry or from the Typer command implementation.

Top-level commands currently include:

- `klaude chat`: interactive agent session in the current directory.
- `klaude ask`: one-shot question with tools enabled.
- `klaude learn`: ingest a URL or local file into a knowledge library.
- `klaude crawl`: same-domain documentation crawl into a refreshable library.
- `klaude docs add/update/list`: manage refreshable docs sources.
- `klaude import-skill`: install a skill ZIP/folder/file and index text files.
- `klaude query`: raw hybrid search over local knowledge, no LLM answer.
- `klaude libraries` and `klaude collections`: list learned libraries.
- `klaude skills`: list installed assistant skills.
- `klaude search`: web search via the configured provider router.
- `klaude code-search`: search programming docs, examples, and debugging refs.
- `klaude huggingface-search/details/readme`: Hugging Face Hub integration.
- `klaude models`: list installed Ollama models and Klaude role assignment.
- `klaude remember`: append a durable fact.
- `klaude memory status/on/off/list/add/forget/search`: durable memory and
  session recall controls.
- `klaude sessions`: list recent sessions.
- `klaude sessions delete SESSION_ID`: delete one session after confirmation.
- `klaude sessions clear`: delete all sessions after confirmation.
- `klaude session-search`: search prior conversation sessions.
- `klaude status`: show configured modes, storage, and permission policies.
- `klaude system-info`: show normalized runtime-context diagnostics.
- `klaude doctor`: verify services, models, config, and data directories.

Chat slash commands currently include:

- `/help` and `/commands`: print the deterministic command reference directly.
- `/models`: list installed Ollama models and mark the active model.
- `/model`: show the active chat model.
- `/model NAME`: switch the active chat model while keeping chat history.
- `/quit`, `/exit`, `/q`: exit the chat session.

When the user explicitly asks for the complete command list, use the
deterministic command-reference handler and preserve its formatting. When the
user asks about one command, use focused command help from the registry. If a
requested command is unsupported, say so and suggest only close registry matches.

## Config, Data, And Secrets

Source checkouts keep local editable config in visible `config/` and runtime
data in gitignored `.klaude/data/` by default. Installed packages outside a
source checkout fall back to `~/.config/klaude/` and `~/.local/share/klaude/`.

Source-checkout config:

- `config/config.toml`: live local app configuration, gitignored.
- `config/.env`: live provider/API secrets, gitignored and expected `chmod 600`.
- `config/searxng.env`: narrow SearXNG service secret only, gitignored.
- `config/online-docs.txt`: live docs seed list, gitignored.
- `config/examples/`: tracked examples for all of the above.

Override locations:

- `KLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`: override config directory.
- `KLAUDE_DATA_DIR`: override data directory.
- `KLAUDE_HOME`: relocate both under one custom home as `config/` and `data/`.
- `KLAUDE_LOG_DIR`: override helper-script log root.

Source-checkout runtime data:

- `.klaude/data/memory.md`: durable facts injected into every system prompt.
- `.klaude/data/sessions.db`: episodic session turns and session search.
- `.klaude/data/knowledge.lance/`: LanceDB tables plus SQLite `fts.db`.
- `.klaude/data/docs-cache/<library>/`: raw learned source cache.
- `.klaude/data/docs-sources/<name>/`: refreshable docs manifests and versions.
- `.klaude/data/skills/<name>/`: installed skill manifests and versions.
- `.klaude/data/runtime-context.json`: volatile cached machine context.
- `.klaude/data/webcache.db`: cached search/fetch/Hugging Face results.
- `.klaude/data/web-provider-state.json`: provider health/cooldown state.
- `.klaude/data/entities.sqlite`: compact learned canonical names, aliases,
  entity types, confidence, and successful-resolution history.

Never commit real secrets. Use `config/.env` for provider API keys. Root `.env`
is ignored for legacy compatibility only. Keep container env files narrow:
SearXNG should read only `config/searxng.env`; do not pass all provider API keys
into Docker services that only need one secret. Do not print `.env`,
`searxng.env`, or expanded Docker Compose configs containing values.

Use `docker compose config --no-env-resolution --no-interpolate` when validating
Compose shape without exposing secrets.

## Ollama

Klaude talks to Ollama directly over HTTP, using `/api/chat`, `/api/embed`, and
`/api/tags` from `packages/core/src/klaude_core/ollama.py`.

Model tier defaults are in `packages/core/src/klaude_core/config.py`:

- `lite`: `qwen3:4b`, `qwen3:1.7b`, no vision, `nomic-embed-text`.
- `standard`: `gpt-oss:20b`, `qwen3:4b`, `minicpm-v`, `nomic-embed-text`.
- `full`: `qwen3-coder:30b`, `qwen3:4b`, `minicpm-v`, `nomic-embed-text`.

The user can override roles in `config/config.toml` under `[models.override]`.
Klaude request tuning belongs under `[ollama.options]` and is sent with each
`/api/chat` request. Supported options currently parsed by config are
`num_ctx`, `num_thread`, `num_gpu`, and `num_predict`. `num_predict` is the
per-response output-token ceiling; Klaude detects an Ollama length stop inside
an unfinished fenced code block and may request up to
`[agent] max_code_continuations` (default 2) continuations. It does not
continue ordinary prose or guess at truncation without Ollama metadata.

Do not put Ollama chat options in `.env`. Do not require Modelfiles for ordinary
tuning. Host-level Ollama daemon settings such as model storage path, keepalive,
parallelism, and daemon context length belong to the Ollama systemd service,
Docker service, or whatever launcher the user chose.

## Agent And Tool Routing

The system prompt is `packages/core/src/klaude_core/prompts/system.md`.

The agent loop in `packages/core/src/klaude_core/agent.py` handles:

- structured Ollama `tool_calls`;
- local-model text tool calls such as
  `<function=web_search> <parameter=query> ... </tool_call>`;
- tool aliases like `search` mapped back to canonical `web_search`;
- provider directives such as `using exa`, `provider: tavily`, or
  `prefer ddgs`;
- deterministic tool exposure for casual turns, command-help requests,
  workspace requests, local knowledge, web lookup, and follow-ups;
- conversation entity state for resolved/unresolved entities, corrections,
  rejected interpretations, active official domains, claim intent, evidence
  gaps, and topic switches;
- a bounded, model-directed retrieval loop; the host preserves safety,
  provenance, deduplication, and budgets but does not synthesize a first search
  or fallback query.
- context-window protection at each user-turn boundary: stale transcript prose
  is compacted before the request reaches Ollama, while the canonical system
  prompt, newest turn, and separate entity state are retained.

Do not use tools for greetings, thanks, introductions, ordinary casual
conversation, or basic identity questions. Answer identity questions directly as
Klaude, a local-first coding assistant.

Use tools when they materially improve correctness or perform a requested
action. The model, not a keyword router, decides whether to call an exposed
tool. The system prompt requires retrieval for fresh public facts and explicit
lookups, while ordinary conversation and stable explanations should answer
directly. The runtime bounds and deduplicates calls but never fabricates a
search merely because the model did not ask for one.

For follow-ups, resolve the subject from the current conversation and preserve
explicit clarifications such as entity type, location, official domain, and
selected meaning. If the user changes the target entity or type, discard
incompatible prior meanings. Never reuse "school" when the clarified target is
"university", and never let an older acronym interpretation steer later queries.

## Tool Safety And Git Discipline

Workspace tools are jailed to the workspace root. `read_file`, `list_dir`,
`grep`, `workspace_info`, `git_status`, and `git_diff` are read-only. Write
tools include `write_file`, `edit_file`, `run_shell` when classified as
non-read-only, and `git_commit`.

`klaude chat` calls `Workspace.ensure_work_branch()` at startup. If the worktree
is clean, Klaude works on a `klaude/<timestamp>` branch and file writes can be
auto-committed. If the worktree is dirty, write tools are disabled and Klaude
must not edit or commit until the user commits or stashes their changes.

`run_shell` classifies commands before execution:

- read-only inspection commands pass the workspace write-lock check, but still
  follow the configured `run_shell` permission policy;
- test/build commands can run when permitted, but require a write-enabled
  workspace because they are not classified as purely read-only;
- workspace-writing commands require write-enabled workspace;
- destructive commands such as `rm`, `rmdir`, `shred`, and `truncate` are
  denied by the tool implementation.

Do not expose file write or shell tools merely because the user asks a tutorial
or framework question. Favor `query_knowledge`, `code_search`, and `web_search`
until the user asks to inspect or modify workspace files.

## Memory And Sessions

Durable memory and episodic session recall are separate:

- `memory.md` stores concise durable facts injected into every chat.
- `sessions.db` stores previous conversation turns for `klaude sessions`,
  `klaude session-search`, `klaude memory search`, and follow-up recall.

Save only high-signal preferences, repeated corrections, project decisions,
durable goals, and important external references. Do not save one-off trivia,
temporary debugging details, raw transcripts, secrets, passwords, or API key
values.

When the user explicitly says `remember that ...` with a clear durable fact,
save it. Broad requests such as `remember this` require a concise summary and
confirmation. If the user asks whether they mentioned something before, use
session search rather than claiming no prior-session access.

`sessions delete` and `sessions clear` require confirmation unless `--yes` or
`-y` is passed.

## Runtime Context

Runtime context is privacy-safe, local, volatile machine context collected by
`packages/core/src/klaude_core/runtime_context.py`. It may include working
directory, Git root/branch/dirty state, OS, shell, hardware summary, displays,
disks, local IPs, local time, timezone, and approximate country inferred from
local timezone data. Fastfetch is preferred, Neofetch is fallback-only, and a
native collector is available.

Runtime context is cached in `.klaude/data/runtime-context.json`; users should
not edit that cache to change hardware facts. Change runtime behavior in
`config/config.toml` under `[runtime_context]` and
`[runtime_context.location]`.

Do not recite runtime specs for casual conversation or simple "where am I?"
questions. `workspace_info` should answer only working directory, repository
root, and write-tool status. Mention approximate physical location only when the
user asks about physical location. Network geolocation is off unless explicitly
configured.

## Knowledge And Atomic Indexing

All learned content should pass through the shared indexing service in
`packages/knowledge/src/klaude_knowledge/indexing.py`. Do not create a new
side-channel writer for docs, skills, CLI, MCP, or `learn_text()`.

The storage invariant is versioned, non-destructive replacement:

- old active chunks remain queryable until all replacement chunks are embedded
  and stored successfully;
- staged rows are not returned by search;
- activation swaps `active_sources` atomically for one owner snapshot;
- manifests and cache files are not proof that indexing succeeded;
- deleting old rows is garbage collection, not part of the critical activation
  path;
- interrupted staging operations can be marked failed/recovered.

SQLite metadata tables:

- `source_versions(version_id, library, owner, source, checksum, status,
  chunk_count, operation_id, created_at, activated_at, error)`
- `active_sources(library, owner, source, version_id)`

Owner examples:

- `learn:<source>`
- `docs:<docs-source-name>`
- `skill:<skill-name>`
- `legacy:<source>` for pre-v2 rows

Retrieval must only return chunks whose `version_id` is referenced by
`active_sources`. Legacy per-library LanceDB tables remain compatible until
their sources are replaced.

Hybrid retrieval in `packages/knowledge/src/klaude_knowledge/hybrid.py` does
vector search plus SQLite FTS5, merges with reciprocal-rank fusion, optionally
reranks with FlashRank, then applies confidence thresholds before returning
context. Fusion retains both vector and lexical ranks for matching chunks, and
an enabled reranker's order remains authoritative after thresholding.

## Docs, Crawling, And Skills

`klaude learn` fetches or reads one source and stores it under owner
`learn:<source>`. It is idempotent for unchanged content and writes raw cache
files under `docs-cache/<library>/` after successful indexing.

`klaude docs add` installs an `llms.txt` source by fetching the index plus
same-domain Markdown/text links. `klaude docs update` refreshes `llms.txt` and
crawled sources. `klaude docs update --online` processes the configured
`config/online-docs.txt`.

Docs sources live under `.klaude/data/docs-sources/<name>/`:

- `manifest.json`
- `CURRENT`
- `versions/<version_id>/`
- `pending-<version_id>.json` while activation is in progress

`klaude crawl` uses the bounded same-domain crawler in `packages/web`. It honors
robots.txt by default, skips binary/media assets, supports sitemap seeding,
include/exclude patterns, max depth/page caps, retry-after handling, randomized
delays, and stores crawl options so docs update can refresh it later.

`klaude import-skill` installs a folder, ZIP, or single file into
`.klaude/data/skills/<name>/`, indexes text-like files only, skips symlinks,
hidden files, binary files, `__MACOSX`, and files above the indexing byte limit.
ZIP extraction rejects unsafe paths. Re-imports create content-addressed
versions and finalize the manifest only after knowledge indexing succeeds.

## Web Search

The web facade is `packages/web/src/klaude_web/facade.py`. The search router is
`packages/web/src/klaude_web/providers.py`.

Search-query name normalization is centralized in
`packages/core/src/klaude_core/entities.py`. It uses compact stable vocabulary,
the local `entities.sqlite` cache, and RapidFuzz before intent/location/
ambiguity planning. It preserves original and normalized query text plus
correction provenance. Exact short acronyms are not fuzzy-expanded without
strong contextual evidence. Optional `[entities.wikimedia] enabled = true`
uses the public, keyless Wikidata entity-search API only for unresolved probable
names, sends only the minimal name phrase, caches accepted canonical names, and
fails closed to the local path on errors or ambiguity.

Search providers use stable lowercase labels:

- `google`
- `parallel`
- `exa`
- `ddgs`
- `tavily`
- `firecrawl`
- `searxng`

Default provider order in code is:

```toml
["google", "parallel", "exa", "ddgs", "tavily", "firecrawl", "searxng"]
```

Users can override order in `config/config.toml` under `[web.search]` with
`provider_order = [...]`. Unknown names are ignored and missing defaults are
appended. Legacy `[web] provider = "local"` means SearXNG-only compatibility,
`"exa"` means Exa compatibility, and `"quality"`/`"auto"` use the
relevance-first router.

Optional API keys use `PROVIDER_API_KEY` names in `config/.env`:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` for Google Search Grounding label `google`;
- `PARALLEL_API_KEY`;
- `TAVILY_API_KEY`;
- `EXA_API_KEY`;
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`;
- `CRAWL4AI_API_KEY` for fetch/crawl extraction endpoints;
- `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` for Hugging Face Hub, separate from web search.

DDGS is keyless when the optional package is installed. SearXNG is local and
uses `config/searxng.env` for its container secret, not `config/.env`.

Search behavior is relevance-first:

- classify query intent and ambiguity;
- treat broad/category searches as source discovery, returning relevant SERP leads without
  requiring each result to prove a final claim;
- keep exact single-entity lookups on the stricter entity-evidence path;
- apply runtime location as a soft signal only when appropriate;
- use lower thresholds for broad candidate discovery;
- return stable runtime result IDs with promising leads, then let the model
  explicitly select which pages to read with `fetch_url`;
- never automatically fetch every result or a script-selected top result;
- apply stricter final verification after fetched evidence;
- skip unconfigured providers silently during ordinary successful searches;
- show concise attempted-provider failures only when fallback occurs or all
  providers fail;
- do not expose provider-specific internal tool names to the model or user.
- fingerprint attempts by normalized query, provider, and options, and skip repeated
  strategies while detecting identical or near-identical result sets.
- treat provider health as a recoverable circuit breaker: one operational
  failure remains eligible, repeated failures enter a timed cooldown, and stale
  degraded states become probeable again;
- cache only searches that return evidence-bearing results, so outages and
  temporary zero-result responses cannot poison later queries;
- preserve the underlying academic, research, or documentation intent when
  freshness words or years are also present.

Ordinary chat web research is a bounded, model-directed loop in
`packages/core/src/klaude_core/agent.py`: the model chooses concise searches,
inspects leads, selectively fetches pages, assesses the remaining information
gap, and stops when evidence is sufficient. `AgenticSearchState` stores only
observable orchestration data and compact functional gaps, never private
chain-of-thought. The runtime enforces `[web.search.behavior]` limits for total
web actions, search calls, fetch calls, pages per domain, and consecutive
failures; exhaustion disables further web actions and gives the model one
best-effort finishing opportunity with gathered evidence.

Search diagnostics remain structured rather than verbose by default. They include the
query, provider, raw count, post-light-filter count, duplicate count, and categorized
rejection reasons.

CLI/TUI rendering must show provider metadata from structured execution data:

- `-> web_search [google]`
- `-> web_search [exa + searxng]` only when results were genuinely combined;
- failed attempts should show the provider labels that actually ran;
- `none` is a structured metadata label for the no-configured-provider case.

The canonical tool name remains `web_search`. Provider labels must come from
structured metadata, not parsed response text. Never log or display API keys,
headers, tokens, sensitive response metadata, or secret fingerprints outside
safe debug logs.

Tavily and Firecrawl are implemented as search providers only. Tavily Extract,
Crawl, Map, and Research are not exposed as Klaude tools. Firecrawl Scrape,
Crawl, Map, Monitor, Parse, Interact, and Research are not exposed as Klaude
tools. `crawl_site` remains Klaude's own bounded same-domain crawler.

Hugging Face Hub lookup is its own integration, not a default web provider.

## URL Fetching

`fetch_url` should render as `-> fetch_url [provider]` in CLI/TUI output. Fetch
metadata should stay structured so CLI, TUI, logs, MCP responses, and tests can
use it consistently.

Search and page reading are separate model-visible operations. Each `Web`
runtime owns an in-memory source registry: SERP leads receive
`search_result_NNN` IDs and successfully fetched documents receive `src_NNN`
IDs. Canonically equivalent URLs reuse the same source, while the existing
SQLite TTL cache avoids repeat downloads across runtimes. Search-query/provider
provenance is attached to fetched sources when available.

The untrusted public `fetch_url` boundary accepts only HTTP(S), rejects URL
credentials and local/private/link-local/metadata targets, resolves hostnames
before connecting, and revalidates every redirect. Download bytes, extracted
content, timeouts, redirect counts, and cache TTL are bounded under
`[web.fetch]`. Webpage text remains a lower-authority tool message marked as
untrusted external evidence; instruction-like text inside a page is data, not
an instruction to the agent.

Fetch providers are:

- `cache`: cached fetch result.
- `direct`: direct HTTP for plain text, Markdown, JSON, and XML.
- `crawl4ai`: optional configured Crawl4AI `/md` endpoint.
- `trafilatura`: local Python HTML extraction fallback.
- `exa`: Exa `/contents` when `[web] provider = "exa"` or `auto` fallback uses
  Exa after local extraction fails.

The preferred default cascade is direct text first, then Crawl4AI when
configured, then trafilatura. This is important for files like
`https://react.dev/llms.txt`, which should not go through HTML extraction.

## MCP Surfaces

`klaude-web-mcp` exposes:

- `web_search`
- `code_search`
- `fetch_url`
- `crawl_site`
- `huggingface_search`
- `huggingface_details`
- `huggingface_readme`

`klaude-knowledge-mcp` exposes:

- `learn_url`
- `learn_file`
- `docs_add`
- `docs_update`
- `crawl_site`
- `import_skill`
- `query_knowledge`
- `list_libraries`
- `list_collections`
- `list_skills`
- `docs_list`

MCP access from Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Cline, Roo, or Continue is
separate from native Klaude chat. Adding Klaude MCP servers to another agent
gives that agent Klaude's web/knowledge tools, not Klaude's whole agent loop,
permission model, or conversation state.

## Current Boundaries

- There is no native VS Code extension or `klaude serve` IDE backend yet.
- The CLI/TUI is the full agent surface today.
- MCP servers expose only web and knowledge capabilities.
- Optional hosted providers may send queries/URLs to third-party services.
- Web search and URL fetch evidence are temporary; they are not written to
  memory or knowledge unless a learn/docs/crawl/import command explicitly does
  so.
- Runtime context is local and volatile; it is not durable memory.

## Development Commands

Use focused checks after relevant changes:

- `uv run pytest tests/unit -q`
- `uv run ruff check .`
- `uv run python -m py_compile <changed-python-files>`
- `bash -n scripts/install.sh`

For secret-safe Compose validation:

- `docker compose config --no-env-resolution --no-interpolate`

Before committing or pushing, inspect:

- `git status --short --branch`
- `git branch -vv`

The worktree may already be dirty with user or generated changes. Never revert
changes you did not make unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Current Development Handoff (2026-08-30)

Treat the Ubuntu server checkout at `/home/klaude/klaude-code` as the canonical
development environment. Windows and VS Code are remote access clients only.
Do not add Windows compatibility unless the user explicitly requests it. Before
acting, inspect the live Ubuntu environment, repository, configuration,
dependencies, documentation, and Git state rather than relying on this snapshot.

Release state at handoff:

- Current release tag: `v0.2.0-alpha.2`.
- Release commit: `63023ad` (`chore: prepare v0.2.0-alpha.2 prerelease`).
- `master` and `origin/master` point to that commit.
- The tag was pushed to GitHub. A GitHub Release page was not created because
  `gh release create` returned HTTP 404, likely an API-token permission issue.
- Last recorded release validation: `uv run pytest tests/unit -q` reported 402
  passing tests; `uv run ruff check .` passed; and
  `bash -n scripts/install.sh` passed. Re-run relevant checks before claiming
  current validity.

Current requested workflow:

- Do not refactor or rewrite immediately.
- First perform repository and Ubuntu-environment reconnaissance.
- Inspect `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, package manifests, deployment files,
  configuration examples, tests, Git history/status, TODOs/FIXMEs, and the
  important implementation files listed below.
- Report what Klaude is, its architecture and execution flow, Git state,
  runtime/deployment, dependencies, testing, security/reliability concerns,
  technical debt, and five high-value next improvements with rationale and
  rough invasiveness.
- Wait for user direction after the reconnaissance report before beginning
  major changes.

Important implementation files to inspect early:

- `packages/core/src/klaude_core/agent.py`
- `packages/core/src/klaude_core/config.py`
- `packages/web/src/klaude_web/providers.py`
- `packages/web/src/klaude_web/facade.py`
- `packages/knowledge/src/klaude_knowledge/indexing.py`
- `packages/knowledge/src/klaude_knowledge/store.py`
